# Loan-Default-Prediction-ML-AI-Python-Notebook

This repository contains an HTML and IPYNB notebook for predicting loan defaulters using Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques. The notebook analyzes various factors influencing loan repayment behavior and provides insights into client profiles likely to default.

## Problem Definition
The objective is to develop a predictive classification model to identify clients at risk of loan default, aiding banks in making informed lending decisions while ensuring compliance with regulations.

## Key Questions
- Analyze and build a model to identify potential loan defaulters.
- Identify key factors influencing loan repayment behavior.
- Understand the profile of clients likely to default.

## Conclusions
After comparing 27 models, the Decision Tree Tuned Feature Selected emerged as the optimal solution. A cost-benefit analysis revealed potential annual savings of approximately 1.8 million dollars with its implementation.

## Ready for Production
The decision tree model's high recall for identifying loan default risk indicates readiness for production. Continuous monitoring and adjustments post-deployment are recommended to maintain effectiveness.

## Challenges To Focus On
- Integration with Existing Systems
- Ensuring Privacy Compliance
- Enhancing Customer Transparency
- Mitigating Data Bias and Fairness

## Actionable Insights and Solution Strategy
- Comparison of Various Techniques
- Cost-Benefit Analysis and Solution Design
- Final Solution Design: Decision Tree Tuned Feature Selected
  
For detailed analysis and insights, refer to the HTML Python notebook.

Note: This repository serves as a demonstration of machine learning techniques for loan default prediction. Actual implementation may require additional considerations and customization.
