# Loan-Default-Prediction-ML-AI (Relevant Notebook:

This repository contains an HTML and IPYNB notebook for predicting loan defaults using Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques.

## Problem Definition
Develop a predictive classification model to identify clients at risk of loan default, aiding banks in making informed lending decisions while ensuring compliance with regulations.

## Key Questions
- Analyze and build a model to identify potential loan defaults.
- Identify key factors influencing loan repayment behavior.
- Understand the profile of clients likely to default.

## Findings
- The notebook develops, tunes, and feature-engineers models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Boosting, LDA, QDA, SVM, and ANN.
- The approach focuses on maximizing recall while also comparing precision and overall model performance to optimize the cost-benefit ratio.
- Reccommends deploying a Decision Tree Tuned Feature-Selected model, which would drive an estimated 1.8 million dollars in annual savings. 

## Implementation Phase Challenges
- Integration with Existing Systems
- Ensuring Privacy Compliance
- Enhancing Customer Transparency
- Mitigating Data Bias and Fairness

## Actionable Insights and Solution Strategy
- Comparison of various techniques
- Cost-benefit analysis and solution design
- Final Solution Design: Decision Tree Tuned Feature-Selected

## Readiness for Production
The high recall of the Decision Tree model indicates readiness for production deployment
