# Loan-Default-Prediction-ML-AI

This repository contains an HTML and IPYNB notebook for predicting loan defaults using Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques.

## Problem Definition
Development of a predictive classification model to identify clients at risk of loan default, aiding banks in making informed lending decisions while ensuring compliance with regulations.

## Key Questions
- Analyze and build a model to identify potential loan defaults.
- Identify key factors influencing loan repayment behavior.
- Understand the profile of clients likely to default.

## Findings
- The notebook develops, tunes, and feature-engineers key models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Boosting, LDA, QDA, SVM, and ANN.
- The approach maximizes recall while balancing precision to optimize the cost-benefit ratio.
- Reccommends deploying a Decision Tree Tuned Feature-Selected model, which would drive an estimated $1.8 million in annual savings. 

## Readiness for Production
The high recall of the Decision Tree model indicates readiness for production deployment.

## Implementation Phase Challenges
- Integration with existing systems
- Ensuring privacy compliance
- Enhancing customer transparency
- Mitigating data bias and fairness

## Actionable Insights and Solution Strategy
- Comparison of various techniques
- Cost-Benefit Analysis and Solution Design
- Final Solution Design: Decision Tree Tuned Feature-Selected
